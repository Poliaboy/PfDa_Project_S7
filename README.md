## Overview

This project is centered around analyzing and predicting heart disease using a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook and a supplementary Streamlit web application. The main focus is on the exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and model training conducted within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to leverage data science techniques to understand the factors contributing to heart disease and to build a predictive model. The project encompasses:

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Detailed exploration and visualization of heart disease data to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transformation of the data to prepare it for modeling.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Building and evaluating a machine learning model to predict heart disease.

## Streamlit Web Application

As an additional component, a Streamlit web application was developed. This app serves as an interactive tool for:

- **User-friendly Interface**: Allowing users to input personal health data and receive a risk prediction.
- **Interactive Data Exploration**: Providing visualizations for a more engaging data exploration experience.

## Data and Model

The analysis and predictions are based on the `heart_disease.csv` dataset, which includes various health parameters. A machine learning model was trained on this dataset and is utilized for predictions in both the Jupyter Notebook and the Streamlit app.

## Conclusions
Appart from the fact we were limited on the amount of data, only 303 rows, we were able to build a model that can predict heart disease with a 85% accuracy. We also found out that the most important features are the maximum heart rate achieved, the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy and the ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- **Insights from Data**: The exploratory data analysis in the Jupyter Notebook provided valuable insights into the factors that contribute to heart disease.
- **Model Performance**: The developed predictive model showed the various performance metrics for different models, improving our understanding of the factors that influence a better performance of a model.
- **Application of ML in Healthcare**: The project underscores the potential of machine learning in enhancing healthcare diagnostics and decision-making.

Future work could focus on improving the model's accuracy, integrating more features, and deploying the Streamlit app for broader accessibility.
